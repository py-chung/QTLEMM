# QTLEMM

In this package, we provide the tool for QTL mapping by EM algorithm. It can handle various populations from different breeding scheme, including backcross (BC), F2, recombinant inbred (RI) populations, advanced intercrossed (AI) populations populations. For each population, both the complete genotyping data and selective genotyping data are considered. The functions allow to use linear regression, interval mapping ([Lander and Botstein 1989](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/121/1/185/5997927)), and multiple interval mapping ([Kao and Zeng 1997](https://biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/teaching/statgen/2006/refs/kao_zeng.pdf); [Kao, Zeng, and Teasdale 1999](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/152/3/1203/6094249?login=true); [Zeng, Kao, and Basten 1999](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/genetics-research/article/estimating-the-genetic-architecture-of-quantitative-traits/D5C17B27152E0240558490E02355D417)) methods for the detection of QTL.
